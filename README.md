How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The CRUD module helped with the functionality of the program. This enabled me to reuse code because of the functions that were featured in the CRUD only had to be written once but could be use multiple times. This way of programming keeps the application simple and easy to read. It also helps with debugging because the simplicity of the CRUD function has made the finding errors in the code easier because of the minimal number of line that was needed to be investigated in order to spot the error. We used the CRUD module for a variety of assignments which made implementing the new assignments easier because how the class built up to project two which involved the dash dashboard.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

The first thing I would consider is what type of problem that needs to be solve and what are the set of requirements that needs to be followed in order to complete the task. For this project we started by learning the back end functionality involving the mongo database. We accessed the database using the terminal. We also used the CRUD function to successfully connect to the mongo database with the assistance of pymongo. The CRUD functions acted as a middle man to connect our backend database mongo to the front end that was utilizing the dash dashboard. In order to get the dash dashboard connected we had to apply HTML commands to customize the visual aspect of the dashboard with the end user in mind. This class introduce me to full stack development and all the components that are necessary to design an successful dashboard. As a future computer scientist the skills learned from this class will help elevate my skillset to become a better programmer 



What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists find solutions to the problems the world presents. Data is used to find the most appropriate way to solve a problem like for instance with  Grazioso Salvare, our application help connect them with potiential animals shelters and access their inventory to find dogs with the attributes that can assist them with rescue operations all across the world.
